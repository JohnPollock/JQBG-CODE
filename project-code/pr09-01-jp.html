<h1>John Pollock</h1>
<div id="bio">
<p>
John Pollock has written a book on JavaScript and one 
 on jQuery. He also runs a Web site where he writes 
 articles on Web development. He is also an odd 
 character, so we let him write some stuff here, too.
</p>
<p>
 You can contact him on his site (which I can't find 
  in a search right now) or on Twitter (he says he has 
  one but he must not have any followers because I can't 
  find it). Just keep searching until you find him.
