<h1>Kool Dude</h1>
<div id="bio">
<p>
Kool Dude is one enigmatic character. I don't know if 
 he actually exists or is someone's alter ego on this 
 Web development forum I visit. Something tells me he 
 is actually just a real person like you and me, though.
</p>
<p>
 I can't find any real contact information for him. The 
  site he lists in his forum profile doesn't work and 
  his e-mail address bounces. He could be on a social 
  network but I just can't find his profile...
